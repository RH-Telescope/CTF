# CTF
This is the RedHat Telescope invitational Capture the Flag event!

This is a 50pt (basic level) CTF, designed as a bit of a fun appetizer to our Telescope Hackathon event in London, UK.

It will cover topics such as network scanning, remote access, web inspection, and encryption!

Don't be discouraged if you struggle to complete it - you will still receive your invitation to the event regardless!

The winner of the CTF (fastest time to completion) will receive a mystery gift!
